## Overview
Clustering is a fundamental technique in image processing, data analysis, and computer vision. This project compares the performance of **K-Means** and **Fuzzy K-Means** algorithms in clustering image datasets for segmentation. The results highlight the effectiveness of fuzzy logic in improving clustering performance.

## Features
- Implementation of **K-Means** and **Fuzzy K-Means** algorithms.
- Image segmentation using clustering techniques.
- Visualization of clustering results and centroids.
- Analysis of algorithm performance based on computation time and accuracy.

## Algorithms
### K-Means Algorithm
- Assigns each data point to the nearest cluster based on the Euclidean distance.
- Iteratively updates cluster centroids until convergence.

### Fuzzy K-Means Algorithm
- Allows each data point to belong to multiple clusters with a degree of membership.
- Incorporates fuzzy logic to improve cluster boundaries.

Both algorithms are implemented for clustering image datasets to demonstrate segmentation accuracy.
